# Wallet Extension - MetaMask Clone

🌟 **Project Overview**

I've been working on building a wallet extension similar to MetaMask, aiming to provide a secure and user-friendly experience for managing cryptocurrency wallets directly from your browser. The project focuses on essential wallet functionalities such as creating and importing wallets, recovering forgotten passwords, fetching account balances, and sending tokens.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔑 **Create Wallet with a Seed Phrase:** Users can easily create a new wallet secured with a seed phrase.
- 🔄 **Import Wallet & Accounts:** Support for importing existing wallets and managing multiple accounts.
- 🔐 **Forgot Password Recovery:** Seamless password recovery using the seed phrase.
- 💰 **Fetch Account Balance via RPC:** Display account balances using RPC calls.
- 💸 **Send Tokens:** Users can send tokens to any address directly from the extension.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js & MongoDB

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is divided into frontend and backend components:

- **client (React.js):** Handles the user interface and interactions with the wallet. It provides a seamless experience for managing accounts, viewing balances, and sending tokens.
- **server (Node.js & MongoDB):** Manages the server-side logic, including wallet creation, account management, and integration with blockchain networks via RPC.
- **smart-contracts (Hardhat):** Running hardhat node locally
